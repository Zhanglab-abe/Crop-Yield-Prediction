# Why do we create this repo?
*This repo is created for participating the 3rd International Workshop on Machine Learning for Cyber-Agricultural Systems: [**MLCAS2021 Crop Yield Prediction Challenge**](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1251/overview). Our team ("AA2") was ranked Top 5 in the competition among 29 teams.*

# Who owns the data shared in this repo?
*This repo is owned by the [Sensing and Automation in Agri-System (SAAS) Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/xin-zhang-lab/home) in the Department of Agricultural & Biological Engineering at Mississippi State University. Please contact the lab PI, [Dr. Xin Zhang](https://www.abe.msstate.edu/people/faculty/xin-zhang/), if you have any questions regarding this repo.*

# How to use this repo?
*We achieved the best prediction accuracy of **soybean** crop yield using XGBoost. The complete code can be found in this [Jupyter Notebook (IPYNB)](https://github.com/Zhanglab-abe/Crop-Yield-Prediction/blob/main/Crop_Yield_Prediction_XGBoost.ipynb). The request of the fully dataset should be sent to the host of the [MLCAS2021 Crop Yield Prediction Challenge](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1251/overview).*
